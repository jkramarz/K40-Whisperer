Version 0.05:
- Added option to support homing in the upper right corner (instead of the upper left corner) for some 50W machines

Previously and error window would pop up and the job would be terminated without user intervention.  During pre-run moves the error window will still pop up.
- Added logic to wait for the laser to finish running a job before the interface becomes active again.

Version 0.21:
- Updated build scripts to eliminate errors on some Windows computers.

- Reduced the number of times the display updates during calculation.
- Fixed speeds for controller boards (except M2).  Higher speeds were inaccurate.

Version 0.29:
- Slowed down the movement to return to the zero position after engraving.  At high speeds the laser head would sometimes over-run and slam into the hard-stop if the job was started from the home position.
- Added command to stop windows computers from going to sleep while the laser is running.

- Added workaround for non UTF-8 characters in SVG files (Files from Adobe Illustrator sometimes have these). 
- Fixed SVG reader so cloned objects work now. 
- Added dialog box to manually set scale for SVG files that do not have physical scale fully defined. You should be able to bring in files without setting the units and view box in Inkscape. (Users will need to verify scale is correct for there designs.) 
- Improved cascading style sheet interpretation for style information. (Some colors could being missed before the improvement.) 
- Fixed crash on startup if data in settings file is incorrect. 
- Changed writing location for error log files to avoid attempting to write to folders that are write protected.
